INFORMATION:
    CACHE SYSTEM:
        Upon opening an audio file or downloading one from the Musicifier Music Library
        the application stores it within .\AppConfig\MusicCache\ this will eventually
        take up space. The application does not remove these cache automatically; In
        order to remove these delete it within the Application by going to the settings
        and clearing Cache. Cache will mostly take up the application's size since audio
        files mostly take up to 3MB

    MPM (Musicifier Playlist Map):
        A playlist file. In order for this to work the text inside of it must be the file name
        the 1st song to play is in the 1st line and then it would be in the next line and so on
        and on.
        Example Code:
            Song 1.mp3
            Song 2.ogg
            Song 3.mp3

This will be removed by the installer and will only be seen in source codes.
