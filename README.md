# Musicifier
## What it does:
Musicifier is a basic application that plays wav, mpm, and mp3 files using command prompt, vbscript and powershell.

### How to download (using zip):
Download the zip file. Then after downloading, extract all files in the zip file in an empty folder. Then press "App.bat" to start it.

### Windows said its unsafe:
If windows said that the program is unsafe it's a false positive, you can look through the code and find that it isn't harmful or anything.

- If "Windows protected your PC" showed up, press "More info" then "Run anyway" this program isn't a malware, Windows is just unsure that if its a malware since its unverified.

- If "Do you want to open this file?" showed up, uncheck "Always ask before opening this file" then open.
